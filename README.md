BFDCA: A Comprehensive Tool of Using Bayes Factor for Differential Co-Expression Analysis
This package contains three main functions:
(1) clustering condition-specific genes into functional DC subunits;
(2) quantitatively characterizing the regulatory impact of genes based on their differential connectivity within DC structures;
(3) providing a DC-based prediction model to predict case/control phenotypes by taking DC significant gene pairs as markers.
