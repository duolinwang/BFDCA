\title{ Plot DC gene pairs }
\description{
 Plot gene expression patterns of DC gene pairs.
}
\usage{
BFplot(dataExp,
       class,
       classlabel,
       gene1,
       gene2
       )
}
\arguments{

  \item{dataExp}{a data frame or matrix containing expression data. Columns correspond to genes and rows to samples. Such as in \link{Compute_bf}.}

  \item{class}{ a numeric or character vector contains the corresponding class information of dataExp. By far, package only accepts binary classes. }

  \item{classlabel}{ a numeric or character vector contains only two values. The first used to label class 1 and the second used to label class 2. The order of these two elements must be kept the same throughout the analyses.}

  \item{gene1}{a numeric or character indicates gene indexes or gene ids for gene1 }

  \item{gene2}{a numeric or character indicates gene indexes or gene ids for gene2. gene1 and gene2 are end-nodes which form one DC gene pair.}

  }
\details{

  The function is used to plot gene expression patterns of DC gene pairs. It will generate a dot plot for the DC gene pairs with x-axis and y-axis represent gene expression levels for each gene in the DC gene pair. Dots in different colors and shapes represent samples from different classes. Circles in different colors represent the 95\% contours of the estimated bivariate normal density from different classes.
