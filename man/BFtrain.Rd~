\title{ Train a DC-based prediction model }
\description{
  Train a DC-based prediction model on training data.
}
\usage{
BFtrain(dataExp, 
        class,
        classlabel,
        edges,
        bfthr=6)
}
\arguments{
  \item{dataExp}{ a data frame or matrix containing expression of training data. Columns correspond to genes and rows to samples. Such as in \code{\link{Compute_bf}}.}

  \item{class}{ a numeric or character vector contains the corresponding class information of dataExp. By far, package only accepts binary classes. }

  \item{classlabel}{ a numeric or character vector contains only two values. The first used to label class 1 and the second used to label class 2. the order of these two elements must be kept the same throughout the analyses. }
 
  \item{edges}{ a data frame or a matrix containing user specified gene pairs, which are the significant DC gene pairs selected by \code{\link{sigDCpair_st1}} and \code{\link{sigDCpair_SFS}}. It consists of at least two columns, the first column indicates ids (or indexes) for gene1, the second column indicates ids (or indexes) for gene2. Ids or indexes of genes must exist in \code{dataExp}.}

  \item{bfthr}{ Bayes factor threshold. Only gene pairs with Bayes factor higher than \code{bfthr} threshold can be considered in the prediction model. The default value is 6.}
}
\details{

  The function trains a DC-based prediction model on training data by using the significant DC gene pairs selected by \code{\link{sigDCpair_st1}} and \code{\link{sigDCpair-SFS}} as features. It generates a model which contains all the estimated parameters for each gene pair under different classes.
 
}
\value{
  
  A \code{DCmodel} object indicates the DC-based prediction model containing all the estimated parameters for each gene pair under different classes.
