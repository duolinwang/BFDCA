Description: BFDCA is a comprehensive tool of using Bayes factor for Differential Co-expression (DC) analysis. BFDCA contains three main functions: (1) clustering condition-specific genes into functional DC subunits; (2) quantitatively characterizing the regulatory impact of genes based on their differential connectivity within DC structures; and (3) providing a DC based prediction model to predict case/control conditions/phenotypes by taking DC significant gene pairs as markers.
